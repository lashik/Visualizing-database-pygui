# Visualizing-database-pygui

This Python project is a small introductory project which was made after learning Tkinter library this application was made to show my understanding and handling of Tkinter, the library every detail is done using Tkinter and the background images are svgs as they provide clear images for every kind of window size making easy to handle and place.

The application works with separate Python files that manage the database and the GUI is handled by a single file.

When the user starts the application they can either load data from a text file or enter every single data in the databases that are given as options to select from at the landing window. After entering the data and clickng the Submit button, a gif appears that helps "visualize" the entry and saving of data and how the data gets saved in the memory.

To run the application make sure to install tkinter, tksvg and Image which are the python libraries used in the project.
